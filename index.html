        <h2>What is Asexuality?</h2>
            <p class = "top">Simply put, asexuality is the sexual attraction to no one. It is a sexual orientation, just like 
                homosexuality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality, and covers a wide spectrum of people under its umbrella. </p>
            <p>If you're still a bit confused about what that means (no worries if you are!), then maybe think of it like this:
                A heterosexual is someone who isn't sexually attracted to the same gender, right? While a homosexual isn't 
                attracted to the opposite gender. Then an asexual is someone who feels what heterosexual feels towards the same
                gender and what a homosexual feels towards the opposite gender. That is, sexually attracted to none of them.
            </p>

        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p> <b>Asexuality means not liking sex</b></p>
            <p class = "top">This is the most widespread misconception I've seen about asexuality, one that I admittedly once held. Contrary
                to popular belief, asexuality is <i>not</i> about sex. In fact, some asexuals may have a libido, or a sex drive. 
                It just tends to not be directed at anyone specifically. 
            </p>

        <p> <b>Asexuals can't get into a relationship</b></p>   
            <p class = "top"> Sexual attraction =/= romantic attraction. Many asexuals can and will enter into happy relationships. </p>

        <p> <b>Asexuality is a choice</b></p>
            <p class = "top"> Being asexual mean it's a part of who you are, and you can't force it to change. Sure, some people 4
                identify as asexual and realize they're not later on in life, but just because people could change doesn't give you 
                the right to invalidate who they are now.
            </p>
            <p>While we're on this topic, it's important to mention that asexuality isn't the same as celibacy, which is the choice to
                refrain from sex. The key difference is in the definition: asexuality, an orientation, and celibacy, a choice. 
            </p>

        <p> <b>Asexuality is a disorder</b></p>
            <p class="top">There is nothing wrong with being asexual. It's not something that needs to be treated, or fixed, 
                or anything like that. In fact, it's this kind of viewpoint that's incredibly harmful to asexuals and causes them
                to feel like there is something wrong with them, not asexuality itself. 
            </p>
          <p> And on that note... </p>

       <p> <b>Asexuality can be """cured""" with sex</b></p>
            <p class = "top"> No. Just... no. Please don't ever think this. Like mentioned before, asexuality is not a choice, and 
                you can't force someone to change. Just let people be who they are; don't cause any unnecessary trauma. 
            </p>

        <h2>How do I know if I'm asexual?</h2>
        <p class="top">If you're questioning whether you're asexual or not, then you're likely somewhere on the spectrum. What sexual 
            attraction feels like is typically easy to tell for non-asexuals. To figure out whether you're asexual or not, simply ask 
            yourself this: Have you ever looked at someone, and at first glance and thought <i> "they're someone I want to have sex 
            with"</i> or something similar? If not, then you're likely asexual.

            <a href="url">The Asexuality Handbook</a>. It has helped me greatly in discovering my own identity, and maybe it'll
            help you too. :) </p>
